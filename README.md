# GhostWare

## Description

GhostWare is an innovative platform that leverages blockchain technology to enhance electoral integrity. By connecting voter credentials to the blockchain through physical devices, such as NFC readers, GhostWare ensures secure and accessible voter registration. This approach minimizes risks of corruption, including vote-buying and duplicate voting, promoting transparency and trust in the electoral process.
